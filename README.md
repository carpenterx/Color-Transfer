# Color Transfer

An application for transfering color values from one file to another.

## About

I created this application in response to this reddit thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/ta42mn/does_anyone_know_a_program_that_takes_values_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/ta42mn/does_anyone_know_a_program_that_takes_values_from/)

### From reddit:

#### Does anyone know a program that takes values from certain lines on one file and adds them to other certain lines on another file?

I have some colour swatches and need to have something automated that basically reads one file, grabs values from certain lines then just inserts them into another file. The reason for this is because I have a program that only works with everything set out in a certain way and its a pain copy and pasting all of them across individually. If anyone would like examples of the two files let me know.
